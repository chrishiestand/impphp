Developed by Chris Adams, this branch is maintained by Chris Hiestand for
his own uses. Although I will try to keep this branch compatible with
other projects, I am not testing this on many platforms so if you use this
you should test it before production use.

ImpPhp (originally ImpUtils) is a collection of PHP scripts and classes that
do various useful things. Really handy functions can be found in Utilities.php,
and a very good database-object model implementation can be found in ImpDB and ImpPDO.

ImpCMS is a simple content management system with basic ACLs.
